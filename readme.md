# PassDB

Password-dump database API server. See accompanying 
[blog post](https://sec.alexflor.es/posts/2020/05/password-dump-database-part-2/) 
for more details.

### Seeding

Dump entries should be in the format:

```
username,domain,password

# where
test@example.com:p4$$w0rd

# becomes
test,example.com,p4$$w0rd
```

Feel free to do this manually, though I had great success using GCP Dataprep

Once in the proper format, you can create the table and import the csv using the GCP Console,
the GCP CLI tool, or the included rake commands.

```bash
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:load[dumps.csv]
```

This will take a while. You may want to manully upload to GCP Storage and copy in the
data from there because if the upload fails with Rake, you'll have to start all over,
and burn through more of your bandwidth.

## Usage

The following enivironment varilables are necessary

```bash
# Project Name
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=

# Format: $project.$dataset.$tablename
export GOOGLE_BIGQUERY_TABLE=

# Obtained from the GCP Auth Console
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./credentials.json

# Have I Been Pwned API key
export HIBP_API_KEY=
```

Install the project deps with:

```bash
gem install bundle
bundle install
```

`server.rb` starts a JSON API for use with the passdb-frontend. 

```bash
bundle exec ruby server.rb 
```

If you don't have a ruby environment set up, using docker may be less of a headache.

```
# build the image
docker build -t passdb-server .

# run the container, passing the necessary environment variables, port maps, and volume mounts
docker run --env-file .env -p 4567:4567 passdb-server bash
```

### Stats

Run `bundle exec rake -T` to see all tasks. 

You can pull table sizes and counts using:

```bash
$ bundle exec rake db:stats
